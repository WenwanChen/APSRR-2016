# Setup

 - Execute download.sh to:
      a) Clone the repos from Github to Desktop.
      b) Download MIR-1K dataset and unzip it 
 - Run the script rpca_mask_script in the code folder.

# Processing and evaluation

The standalone code is provided for a varying dataset, e.g. 10 songs randomly chosen of 1000 song clips, for this the variable N has to be changed before running the script. Check that all files/folders are correctly placed within the working folder.

The code includes addpath for specifically named folders, so change the names to suit you in the code (as well), if so desired.

When you run the script *rpca_mask_script.m*, you obtain all the evaluation figures as shown in the paper. 
 
Notice that, for 10 song clips, the simulation run for roughly 35 minutes, which is why the whole MIR-1K dataset (1000 song clips) was not used.

To use the whole dataset, run the script after changing N to 1000.

Warning: This simulation might take a long time if you do not use the parallel computing toolbox!
