# Machine Setup

For the writing of code, a Macbook pro installed with MATLAB_R2015b was used. The code was also run on a Whindows 10 platform running MATLAB_R2016b to obtain the same results.

The MIR-1K Dataset(https://sites.google.com/site/unvoicedsoundseparation/mir-1k) is used ( and should separately be downloaded by the user).
