# Setup

 - Clone the repo from Github.
 - Check for compliance or lack thereof with reuiemwnts.txt
 - Download MIR-1K dataset (add to working folder) if needed for verification, otheriwse all used files are included.
 - In case of use of dataset, use the script extract_mixtures.m to obtain various mixtures.

# Processing and evaluation

The standalone code is provided for a specific dataset. Check that all files/folders are correctly placed within the working folder.
The code includes addpath for specifically named folders, so change the names to suit you in the code (as well), if desired.

Run the scripts in the following order to obtain all the evaluation results as shown in the paper. 
 1. rpca_mask_demo.m
 2. rpca_mask_demo_extended.m
 3. plotting.m
 
Notice that, for roughly 10 song clips, the simulation run for roughly 35 minutes, which is why the whole MIR-1K dataset 
(1000 song clips) was not used.
