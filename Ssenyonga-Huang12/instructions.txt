# Setup

 - Clone the repo from Github.
 - Check for compliance or lack thereof with requirements.txt
 - Download MIR-1K dataset (add to working folder) if needed for all 1000 songs or different songs, otheriwse all used files are included.
 - In case of use of dataset, use the script extract_mixtures.m to obtain various mixtures.

# Processing and evaluation

The standalone code is provided for a specific dataset (10 randomly chosen of 1000 song clips). Check that all files/folders are correctly placed within the working folder.

The code includes addpath for specifically named folders, so change the names to suit you in the code (as well), if so desired.

Run the script *rpca_mask_script.m* to obtain all the evaluation figures as shown in the paper. 
 
Notice that, for 10 song clips, the simulation run for roughly 35 minutes, which is why the whole MIR-1K dataset 
(1000 song clips) was not used.

To use the whole dataset, run the script *extract_mixtures.m* first and then proceed by running script *rpca_mask_script.m*. 

Warning: This simulation will take at least 4 full days!
